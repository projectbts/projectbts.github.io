        <p class="lead">To establish relationships with youth, we must understand their development. Beginning around ages 9 to 11, pre-adolescent physical development moves to the forefront. Soon after, they begin to experience growth spurts at different rates that progessively moves them towards adolescence. During these primary stages of cognitive development, most young people take on more independence. They begin to consider future careers and occupations. And as their decision-making skills develop, so does their capability for abstract thought and social conscience. Social problems such as poverty become apparent and increasingly complex. Providing aid in these developing stages of life improves the lives of the most vulnerable and creates an effective agent of change. The BTS Project currently has collected donations and hygiene products for distribution. We plan to permeate the daily struggles of Haitian orphans and bring awareness to those who deal with mental health disorders.</p>
